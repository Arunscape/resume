I am always looking to learn something new. During my last job at
ATB Financial, I was part of an agile team that worked on the new
online banking platform for business customers. I had the pleasure of learning
how to leverage several technologies, such as React, Redux, Google Cloud
Platform, Docker, and Jenkins to name a few. I also had the opportunity to 
mentor a team of students and recent graduates to solve a business case
problem. These opportunities have taught me how to work in an agile team,
meet deadlines, not being afraid to fail fast, and
having fun with my teams.

%tell them what application materials you have submitted and where
I will be available to commence employment starting {\STARTAVAILABLE},
but I am available for an interview immediately. I can be contacted at the
e-mail address or phone number below. Thank you for taking the time to consider
my application. I look forward to further discussing how I can make a positive
contribution to \COMPANYNAME.
